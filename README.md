# Reinforcement Learning Project: Winning Atari Pong on pixels

In this project we have explored Atari Pong game
environment from OpenAI gym. To win the game the agent has
to bounce the ball past the other player enough times given
raw pixels of the screen as input. We have implemented two
reinforcement learning algorithms: Deep Q-Network and Policy
Gradient introducing a fully connected eural network and
a convolution neural network agents.
After training the agents for several thousand episodes against
a manually coded AI algorithm provided by OpenAI we are able
to conclude basing on reward progression analysis that in case of
policy gradient approach CNN agent performs significantly better
that the FCN agent, but the Deep Q-Network agent outperforms
them both in this task.
In this project I implemented policy gradient approach (for which you can find the code here) and DQN was imlemeted by Nikita Karaev.
